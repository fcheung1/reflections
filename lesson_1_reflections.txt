How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Diff shows a side by side comparison of changes within the code allowing me to spot errors easily. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having easy access to earlier versions of a file allows me to debug my code quicker 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually choosing when to create a commit allows the programmer to have control over the number
of versions generated. Doing so allows for easier debugging using diff. In the case of Google docs, 
having so many versions make it impossible to spot which version holds the bugs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Verison control systems like Git allow saving multiple files in one commite because these
types of VC are specifically meant for code, which can have multiple files dependent on one 
another. Google Docs on the other hand are mainly used for one off reporting/documents so saving one file at 
a time makes more sense. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log presents a list of all the commits for a given repository, while using the git diff command you can select the 
old commit and compare it to the new commit. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I am not worried about my changes because I can always check by using an older commit 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to start using Git in order to test diferent versions of my code
